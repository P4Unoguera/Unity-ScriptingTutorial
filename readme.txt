This project is part of the introduction on Unity for the Interaction Systems' subject in my Audiovisual Systems Engineering bachelor in UPF. The professor has encourage us to complete and improve the "Introduction to Unity Scripting" Tutorial from Unity.

---

Once I have finished the first part of "Introduction to Unity Scripting" tutorial, I have done its second part. That includes:
- Creation and implementation of the sheep spawns (handle lists and add/remove of game objects).
- Add visual enhancements and score track, to improve experience.
- Add sound effects with a Sound Manager.
- Manipulating User Interface, add a Game UI (title scene, game over window).
- Changing the user Hay Machine color.

Furthermore, I add some little features in order to improve the game. 

Firstly, I fixed a sheep drop issue. After implementing the second part of the tutorial, I faced a problem where dropping a sheep counted as two sheep falling. To solve it, I followed the same approach as handling the hitByHay proccess. That is creating a boolean variable "dropped" to identify when a sheep has fallen or not. This ensures the DroppedSheep() function is only called once, handle correctly the number of sheeps dropped.

Next, I have done a simple script called SheepDancing() to make the two sheeps of the title scene do a little "dance" by changing its rotation separatly. And I also add the smoke particles of the Hay Machine in the title scene.

Moreover, I have include a Game Win Window by duplicating the existing Game Over Window and creating a new variable called "sheepSavedBeforeGameWin", then when we achieve the goal of saved sheeps the Game Win Window pops up.

Finally, I have changed the audio clips of some of the actions and add many other sound effects to improve the experience.
- Change of the sheep drop sound -> Short Whistle Fall: https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/falling/
- Add sound effect when losing the game -> Musical game over: https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/discover/gameover/
- Add sound effect when winning the game -> WinBanjo: https://freesound.org/people/Fupicat/sounds/521640/
- Add background game theme loop -> Krasnodar Fury theme: https://freesound.org/people/SwimmingRock/sounds/647626/

In conclusion, while the new features and improvements do not alter the core gameplay, they refine the overall experience.
